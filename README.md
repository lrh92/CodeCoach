# CodeCoach

CodeCoach helps connect young women starting out in tech with a mentor to guide them through the learning process. 

Many websites and resouces exist to help people teach themselves code, but who do you turn to when you get stuck? When you complete the HTML track on CodeCademy and don't know what to do next? 

We help match mentors with learners who can give tips and pointers on where to start with coding and how to progress through the basics and beyond.
