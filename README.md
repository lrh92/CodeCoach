# CodeCoach

CodeCoach helps connect young women starting out in tech with a mentor to guide them through the learning process. 

Many websites and resouces exist to help people teach themselves code, but who do you turn to when you get stuck? When you complete the HTML track on CodeCademy and don't know what to do next? 

We help match mentors with learners who can give tips and pointers on where to start with coding and how to progress through the basics and beyond.

# About Us
 

  Mentors
Mentors are the best thing about our project - they give up their time to help budding coders find their way! If you have great skills in any coding language, or maybe you're even a full stack developer, we'd love for you to sign up. You'll help others make their websites great, and may even learn something yourself along the way.

  Mentees
If you're hoping to improve your coding skills and are getting stuck on something you can't find help with anywhere, set up a request and a mentor will come to the rescue. Many build great relationship with their mentors - we've even had mentees go on to becoming mentors themselves!
