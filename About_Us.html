	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<h2>Mentors</h2>
	<p>Mentors are the best thing about our project - they give up their time to help budding coders find their way! If you have great skills in any coding language, or maybe you're even a full stack developer, we'd love for you to sign up. You'll help others make their websites great, and may even learn something yourself along the way.</p>
	<h2>Mentees</h2>
	<p>If you're hoping to improve your coding skills and are getting stuck on something you can't find help with anywhere, set up a request and a mentor will come to the rescue. Many build great relationships with their mentors - we've even had mentees go on to becoming mentors themselves!</p>
